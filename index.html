            Thankyou for showing interest, 
            here is a quick story of me and
            this website. My programming 
            journey started back in 2019, 
            few months before I started 
            studying CSE in LNCT Bhopal. 
            I am currently in my second 
            year and doing Technical 
            Content Writing Internship
            at GeeksForGeeks. I like 
            coding all kind of problems 
            from the very basic like adding 
            numbers to the complex ones like
            competitive programming problems.
            I love making projects and games.
            Infact this website is one of my 
            Web Development Projects which 
            is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
            <br>Languages known : C Language, 
            C++, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, 
            MySQL.<br> IT Constructs : Data 
            Structures and Algorithm, OOP,
